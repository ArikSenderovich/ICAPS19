\label{sec:solution}




In this section, we provide our end-to-end 
solution for learning scheduling models from data, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}. 
Given an event log, we apply a process mining method from~\cite{} 
to discover a timed Petri net, which represents
the underlying system.
